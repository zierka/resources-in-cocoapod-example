# Resources in cocoapod example
An example on how to add/use resources in/from a cocoapod.

You might want to create a dynamic framework with all your assets, or add assets to your existing framework, to easily share them across projects.

While this isn't hard to do, there are some tricky bits that are not immediately obvious.

In this example there is an `exampleFramework`, which is a cocoapod, that contains some resources (images and a txt file), and an `exampleProject` that uses this framework.

The key thing is to get the resource bundle, which is generated by cocoapods.

    /// Need a class from the framework to get it's bundle. Bundle identifier can also be used, but it might changes. Now it's something like org.cocoapods.exampleFramework for this bundle
    let frameworkBundle = Bundle(for: DummyClass.self)
        
    var resourceBundle: Bundle?
        
    // "exampleFrameworkResources" is the name of the resource bundle defined in .podspec
    if let resourceBundleUrl = frameworkBundle.url(forResource: "exampleFrameworkResources", withExtension: "bundle") {
        resourceBundle = Bundle(url: resourceBundleUrl)
    }

Now you can use the `resourceBundle` `Bundle` object to get files located in that bundle.

Steps to try it out:
- clone the repo
- open and run exampleProject/exampleProject.xcworkspace
- you will see some images and text that are from the resource bundle located in the framework
